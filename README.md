# Awesome Label-free Reinforcement Learning Papers

Warning: This repo is built for researchers interested in the recent "flurry" in RL field. Many new papers claim to improve the ‚Äúreasoning abilities‚Äù in language models. However, as shown by [recent work](https://safe-lip-9a8.notion.site/Incorrect-Baseline-Evaluations-Call-into-Question-Recent-LLM-RL-Claims-2012f1fbf0ee8094ab8ded1953c15a37#2022f1fbf0ee80cb9b18f7eac460410a), the improvement of most of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) papers could be a mirage due to various accidental issues in the evaluation setups. The baseline numbers of the pre-RL models may be massively underreported. Thus we should carefully examine the degree by which true learning happens.
