# A Collection of Label-free Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards Papers

By [Qingyang Zhang](qingyangzhang.github.io). If there are any papers I missed, please let me know!

Warning: As shown by recent work, the improvement of most of RLVR papers could be a mirage due to various accidental issues in the evaluation setups. The baseline numbers of the pre-RL models may be massively underreported. Thus we should carefully examine the degree by which true learning happens.
